I built a production-ready RAG system.

Zero code written.

Here's how n8n changes the AI game:

Most developers spend weeks building RAG pipelines.
I did it in 2 workflows.


WORKFLOW 1: Data Ingestion

→ Pull data from Google Sheets
→ Process and transform fields
→ Generate embeddings with OpenAI
→ Store vectors in Supabase

60 documents ingested. One click.


WORKFLOW 2: RAG Chat Agent

→ Chat trigger receives messages
→ Google Gemini powers the AI brain
→ Simple Memory keeps conversation context
→ Supabase retrieves relevant docs
→ OpenAI embeddings find the matches

The result?

An intelligent chatbot that answers questions using YOUR data.

No Python scripts.
No complex infrastructure.
No deployment headaches.

Just drag, drop, connect.

The AI revolution isn't about who can code the best.

It's about who can build the fastest.

n8n + Supabase + OpenAI + Gemini = Instant RAG system

Thanks Ed Donner for the great course!
